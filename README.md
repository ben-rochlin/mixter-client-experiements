This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## A Next.js project for experimenting with features to be implemented into my 'mixter' news article reader and aggregator.

currently experimenting with multiple features to be included:

1. Displaying html from external websites within the app. 
2. Using a text to voice engine to allow the user to listen to news articles.
